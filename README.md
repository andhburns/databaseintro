# Setup Instructions

For this class we will be using a Postgres database installation.  Presentations will be done using a Mac OS X installation but you can attempt to follow along with a PC install as we will not be doing advanced things.

Here is the link to installation packages for all platforms

Choose Mac or PC and follow the prompts to install version 9.5.4. On PC it can be 32-bit or 64-bit.

It will ask you for a password for the superuser so make sure it is simple for you to remember in class.

When asked for the locale and port simply take the defaults

Do not install the Stack Builder for our class as it will be for more advanced users
